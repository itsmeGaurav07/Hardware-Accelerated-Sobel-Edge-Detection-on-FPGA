# Hardware-Accelerated-Sobel-Edge-Detection-on-FPGA
Designed and implemented a real-time Sobel edge detection pipeline on PYNQ-Z2 (Zynq-7000) FPGA using Verilog HDL. Developed a 3×3 sliding window architecture for streaming image processing, implemented signed gradient computation and thresholding, and deployed the RTL design using Xilinx Vivado with proper pin constraints.
